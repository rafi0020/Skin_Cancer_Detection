## üìÑ Project Overview

### Motivation
Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is among the most prevalent cancers globally, with Bangladesh facing a significant shortage of dermatologists. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment, and this project aims to bridge the diagnostic gap using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

### Objectives
1. Develop a DCNN for classifying benign and malignant skin lesions.
2. Enhance interpretability using saliency and attention maps.
3. Compare the performance of the proposed model with existing transfer learning models like AlexNet, ResNet, VGG16, DenseNet, and MobileNet.
